    "Cross-validation is a statistical method used to estimate the performance of machine learning models. It is a method for assessing how the results of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent data set. Cross-validation is a technique for evaluating ML models by training several ML models on subsets of the available input data and evaluating them on the complementary subset of the data. Use cross-validation to detect overfitting, ie, failing to generalize a pattern."

    "In Cross-Validation, we use our initial training data to generate multiple mini train-test splits. Use these splits to tune your model. For example in standard k-fold cross-validation, we partition the data into k subsets. Then, we iteratively train the algorithm on k-1 subsets while using the remaining subset as the test set. In this way, we can test our model on completely unseen data. In this notebook, you can read about the 7 most commonly used cross-validation techniques along with their pros and cons. I have also provided the code snippets for each technique."
